# TO-DO-LIST-
In this project, I built a simple to-do list using Stack in the C language.
Project Title: TO - DO LIST 
Concepts Used: STACK
Language : C

In this project, we implemented the real-world application of the data structure "STACKS". 
The code is divided into different functions in order to increase code reusability and the optimal functionality of the code.
Functions and methods used in this code are:
           1.initializeStack()
           2.push()
           3.pop()
           4.displayTasks()
           5. main()

ANY SUGGESTION ARE WELCOME.
